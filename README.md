In this project, I am practicing the skills that The Odin Project has
taught to me in the Foundations course. I am going to be making a website,
perhaps not the prettiest one, to practice my skills in HTML development
and navigating my computer through the command line, saving and committing
repositories via Git/Github. I will be making full use of what I have learned,
including commit messages, developer notes, code-cleanliness, and the sort.
Good luck me!
